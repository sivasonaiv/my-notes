Blocking model
	Shared Mutable State
		large no of stateful objects whose state can be changed by multiple parts of your application
		solve this problem by preventing multiple threads from mutating data simultaneously
		Blocking
	
Non Blocking concurrency model
	Actor model
	
Concurrency Vs Parallelism
	Concurrency is when two tasks may start, run and complete with overlapping time periods
	(Multitasking on single core machine)
	Parallelism is when tasks literally run at the same time (Multithreads on Multicore processor)

Synchronous Vs Asynchronous
	A method call is Synchronous if the caller cannot make progress until the method returns a value or throws an exception
	
	A method call is Asynchronous if the caller can make progress after a finite number of steps and the completion of the method
	may be signaled via some additional mechanism (callback, future or message)
	
Actor model is Asynchronous in nature

Non-Blocking Vs Blocking
	Blocking is when if the delay of one thread can indefinitely delay some of the other threads 
	Non-blocking means that no thread is able to indefinitely delay others

Race condition
	when multiples have a shared mutable stat, In fact, problems only arise if one or more of the threads try to change this state at the same time
