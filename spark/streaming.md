It simply forms a series of events that arrive at the stream processing system (e.g., credit card transactions, clicks on a website, or sensor readings from Internet of Things [IoT] devices)

 the Structured Streaming developers coined the term continuous applications to capture end-to-end applications that consist of streaming, batch, and interactive jobs all working on the same data to deliver an end product.
