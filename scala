Why Scala?
Expressive
	First-class functions
	Closures
Concise
	Type inference
	Literal syntax for function creation
Java interoperability
	Can reuse java libraries
	Can reuse java tools
	No performance penalty

Think Scala
	Scala is not just a nicer Java. You should learn it with a fresh mind- you will get more out of these classes.


Arrows
<-, -> and => are completely different things with completely different uses in Scala - it doesn't make a lot of sense to compare them.

<- is used in for comprehensions. On the right side of the <- is a generator, which is an instance of a type with a foreach method, which generates the elements that the for is going to loop over. Note that the generator does not need to be a collection - anything that has a foreach method will work (it can for example be an Option).

-> is a method that creates a tuple. This method is often used when creating a Map with a convenient, readable syntax. For example:

val map = Map("one" -> 1, "two" -> 2, "three" -> 3)
Note that "one" -> 1 is the same as ("one", 1) (a Tuple2 containing the values  "one" and 1), etc.

=> is used in function literals and function types, it's the separator between the function's (or function type's) arguments and body (or return type).

main()
Scala doesn't have static like Java. Anything that you would make static in Java, you would put in an object instead of in a class in Scala.
Since the main() method should be static, it must be defined in an object in Scala instead of in a class.
Ofcourse you could create a main() method in a class, but you cannot use this as the entry point of an application - it would just be a regular method that happens to be named main.

Anonymous Functions
	You can create anonymous functions.
	scala> (x: Int) => x + 1
	res2: (Int) => Int = <function1>

Function
	def timesTwo(i: Int): Int = {
  		println("hello world")
		i * 2
	}

underscore (_)  - unnamed magical wildcard - mean different things in different context
	scala> def adder(m: Int, n: Int) = m + n
	adder: (m: Int,n: Int)Int
	
	scala> val add2 = adder(2, _:Int)
	add2: (Int) => Int = <function1>

	scala> add2(3)
	res50: Int = 5

Curried Function
	apply some arguments to your function now and others later
	
	scala> def multiply(m: Int)(n: Int): Int = m * n
	multiply: (m: Int)(n: Int)Int
	
	scala> multiply(2)(3)
	res0: Int = 6

	scala> val timesTwo = multiply(2) _
	timesTwo: (Int) => Int = <function1>

	scala> timesTwo(3)
	res1: Int = 6


Variable length arguments
	def capitalizeAll(args: String*) = {
	  args.map { arg =>
    	arg.capitalize
	  }
	}

Constructor
	Constructors arenâ€™t special methods, they are the code outside of method definitions in your class
	
	class Calculator(brand: String) {
  	/**
	 * A constructor.
   	 */
  	val color: String = if (brand == "TI") {
    	"blue"
	  } else if (brand == "HP") {
    	"black"
	  } else {
    	"white"
	  }

	  // An instance method.
	  def add(m: Int, n: Int): Int = m + n
	}


	scala> val calc = new Calculator("HP")
	calc: Calculator = Calculator@1e64cc4d

	scala> calc.color
	res0: String = black




scala> capitalizeAll("rarity", "applejack")
res2: Seq[String] = ArrayBuffer(Rarity, Applejack)



Collection
Tuple
	A tuple groups together simple logical collections of items without using a class
		val hostPort = ("localhost",80)
		hostPort: (String, Int) = (localhost, 80)
	Unlike case classes, they dont have named accessors, instead they have accessors
	that are named by their position and is 1-based rather than 0-based
		hostPort._1 => localhost
		hostPort._2 => 80

	simply making tuple of 2 values using ->
		1 -> 2
		response: (Int, Int) = (1,2)

Maps
	Map(1 -> 2)
	Map("foo" -> "bar")
	
	create Tuple as entry to map
