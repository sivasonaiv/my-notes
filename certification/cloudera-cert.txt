Data Ingest
The skills to transfer data between external systems and your cluster. This includes the following:
	
	Import data from a MySQL database into HDFS using Sqoop
	Export data to a MySQL database from HDFS using Sqoop
	Change the delimiter and file format of data during import using Sqoop
	Ingest real-time and near-real time (NRT) streaming data into HDFS using Flume
	Load data into and out of HDFS using the Hadoop File System (FS) commands

Transform, Stage, Store
Convert a set of data values in a given format stored in HDFS into new data values and/or a new data format and write them into HDFS. This includes writing Spark applications in both Scala and Python (see note above on exam question format for more information on using either Scala or Python):

	Load data from HDFS and store results back to HDFS using Spark
	Join disparate datasets together using Spark
	Calculate aggregate statistics (e.g., average or sum) using Spark
	Filter data into a smaller dataset using Spark
	Write a query that produces ranked or sorted data using Spark

Data Analysis
Use Data Definition Language (DDL) to create tables in the Hive metastore for use by Hive and Impala.

	Read and/or create a table in the Hive metastore in a given schema
	Extract an Avro schema from a set of datafiles using avro-tools
	Create a table in the Hive metastore using the Avro file format and an external schema file
	Improve query performance by creating partitioned tables in the Hive metastore
	Evolve an Avro schema by changing JSON files
